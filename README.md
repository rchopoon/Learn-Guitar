## Learn and Practice Guitar



### Goal
I have been learning guitar from [Justinguitar](http://www.justinguitar.com/en/BC-000-BeginnersCourse.php). I was never serious about my learning, hence, I am still dabbling here and there.
I want to be serious about guitar learning. I have completed a course, [**Introduction to Guitar**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/guitar), from Coursera.org. This course was great intro for me and I understood a relationship between notes and sclaes.
So, this is my attempt to keep track of what I learned.

The big problem on learning curve, for me, has been the lack of reviewing. I hope to have easy access to reivew with this repository. 

The big goal is to be able to play and reconginze notes by the end of another year, 2017.

   1. Set Long Term Goals

      Having a long term goals helps. You will have a direction of where you are going. Then you can practice towards your goal, go one step closer to your goal each day. It is also helpful to set some deadline. Say something like, By the end of year, I am going to learn to play at least one song. Maybe know the notes on the neck of guitar by the end of month. This will help you keep track of what you are learning.
      Some goals:

         + Play/Jam in a band
         + Entertain in a group
         + Learn that slick Pink Floyd solo
   
      The sense of purpose is great, because often times, questions will be asked as to why you are doing boring practice sessions.

   2. What to practice?

      Practice with no sense of directions will soon demotivate you. so practice on each of this topics. 

      + Technique
         - finger dexterity,
         - strummings, chord change
      + Knowledge
         - Vocabulary
         - Harmony, music theory
         - Notes in the neck
      + Transcribing
         - Ear training
         - Aural training
      + Repertoire
         - Songs you know (easy, solo-leads)
      + Improvisation
         - Jazz or pentatonics
       
      

   3. Keeping a practice routine.

      + Have a practice routine
         + it is self motivating and you will see the progress
      + Practice less items or don't go for all the items.
      + Always leave when the practice time is over.
      + one hour X 5 day is good routine to have. or else commit some time for guitar practice.
      + Good to have a off day too.

   4. Always use metronome
      + 5 minutes for one technique then follow it.
         + this will keep you focused.
         + if you see the end, like only two minutes more, the practice session will be lot easier.
      + 5 minutes of **proper* practice (no phones and distractions)
      + don't count learning video as practice.  
      + Tap your foot in each mertronome.

   5. Practice makes permanent
      + Try and get things right the first time.
      + Takes a lot a time to correct a wrong technqiue learnt.
      + Hence, play slow then increase the rhythm, smooth.

      > Measure twice and cut once.

   6. Always start **SLOW**
      + No point in trying fast and making mistakes.
      + Try to get full tone slowly
         + transcibe, using _audacity_ slowly playback.
         + Extract those hard part and do slow(later increase the tempo)
      + Increase the temp when you play 4 times perfectly CONSECUTIVELY.
      + Trick to play fast is to start slow, in perfect tone.
         + Listen to **Steve Vai** play in slow, he hits the perfectly and precisely.

   7. Observing Mistake
      + Be unbiased to your own mistake*.
      + Try to make a mistake then observe
         + mistake goes away
         + you are watching making mistake then you will know what is wrong.
         + like angle of picks, some muted strings.

   8. Use Visualization
      + It mind that learn stuffs and technique.
      + You can practice without your guitar
         + imagine a scales/arpegio
      + Try to hear the chords too

   9. Practice without instruments
      + Notes on the guitar neck
         + Staves(memorization)
      + Rhythm tapping
      + Music theory practice book.
      + Tap foot on music.
      + Ear training apps. 
      + Imagine rhythm (with hands) pattern. [up, up down]
      + Mermorizing Jazz standards.
