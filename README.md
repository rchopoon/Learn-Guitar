## Learn and Practice Guitar



### Goal
I have been learning guitar from [Justinguitar](http://www.justinguitar.com/en/BC-000-BeginnersCourse.php). I was never serious about my learning, hence, I am still dabbling here and there.
I want to be serious about guitar learning. I have completed a course, [**Introduction to Guitar**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/guitar), from Coursera.org. This course was great intro for me and I understood a relationship between notes and sclaes.
So, this is my attempt to keep track of what I learned.

The big problem on learning curve, for me, has been the lack of reviewing. I hope to have easy access to reivew with this repository. 

The big goal is to be able to play and reconginze notes by the end of another year, 2017.
