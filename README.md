## Learn and Practice Guitar



### Goal
I have been learning guitar from justinguitar.com. I was never serious about my learning, hence, I am still dabbling here and there.
I want to be serious about guitar learning. I have completed a course, **Introduction to Guitar**, from Coursera.org. This course was great intro for me and I understood a relationship between notes and sclaes.
So, this is my attempt to keep track of what I learned.

The big problem on learning curve, for me, has been the lack of reviewing. I hope to have easy access to reivew with this repository.
